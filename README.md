# Confectionery Backend API - Django Framework Implementation

This project provides a backend API, storage and endpoints for a generic toy confectionery, using the Python Django web framework. It allows data storage in four database tables, containing one one-to-many relation and two many-to-many relations. The backend API stores the data using SQLite.
